    "This book can be useful for both novices who never really programmed before, and for students with more techical background, who desire to know about data extraction, cleaning, analysis and visualization (among used frameworks there are Pandas, Numpy and Jupyter editor). Data is going to be processed in a practical way, without delving into more advanced considerations about algorithmic complexity and data structures. To overcome issues and guarantee concrete didactical results, step-by-step tutorials are presented. "
