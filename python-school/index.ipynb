    "Nowadays, more and more decisions are taken upon factual and objective data. All disciplines, from engineering to social sciences, require to elaborate data and extract actionable information by analysing heterogenous sources. This book of practical exercises gives an introduction to coding and data processing using [Python](https://www.python.org), a programming language popular both in the industry and in research environments."

    "## Intended audience\n",
    "\n",
    "This book can be useful for both novices who never really programmed before, and for students with more techical background, who desire to know about data extraction, cleaning, analysis and visualization (among used frameworks there are Polars, Numpy and Jupyter editor). Data is going to be processed in a practical way, without delving into more advanced considerations about algorithmic complexity and data structures. To overcome issues and guarantee concrete didactical results, step-by-step tutorials are presented. "
